# Arkham Cards

Create and edit decks for all of your investigators -- it will even check the deck-building rules to keep you honest. You can also group together decks into campaigns to track your progress combatting evils. The app can be used with local decks, or you can link your ArkhamDB accountto sync changes on the go.

* Edit and upgrade your investigator's decks, either offline or by linking your ArkhamDB account.
* Track scenario results and keep the campaign log up to date.
* Keep track of investigator trauma and assign new random basic weaknesses as you take on new madness.
* Log the chaos bag as it changes, letting you have multiple campaigns going at once as you wait for the next month's mythos pack.
* Use the advanced card search to search by trait, health, shroud, etc. A great tool if you ever need to evaluate how many 'non-elite' enemies can be targeted by a card or know which locations a Flashlight wielding Zoey can actually stand a chance at investigating.
